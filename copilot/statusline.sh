# Copilot CLI status line. Example output:
#   🤖 sonnet-5m 55/264K 21% | $0.09 ∈ Session: $0.4 | 26%↗ ($0.9/$3.5) left today | +3%⊂95% $66 (6646 AIC) / 20wd7h left
#
#   • model: display_name with the "claude-" prefix stripped, the reasoning
#     effort glued on as one letter (medium→m, high→h, xhigh→x, low→l) and the
#     " · N context" tail replaced by "<used>/<limit>" context tokens, sharing
#     one unit suffix ("119/264K"), plus a bare % (used count coloured yellow
#     ≥65% / red ≥95%; % hidden when the window is 1M).
#   • turn ∈ session: what the LAST TURN burned, then the session total it is part
#     of, worded like Copilot's own footer ("Session: 285.11 AIC used") so the two
#     can be read against each other — in dollars, since that is the unit the rest
#     of the line speaks. The turn is the running session total minus what it
#     was when that turn started. Where a turn starts comes from the
#     userPromptSubmitted hook (turn-mark.sh), which drops a marker this script
#     turns into a baseline on its next render; absent before a session's first
#     prompt. Frozen once the turn ends, so walking back to a session tells you
#     what the prompt you left running actually cost. The session figure is the only live credit
#     figure on the line, and the one Copilot itself prints in its footer as
#     "Session: 11.18 AIC used". It arrives in the payload on every render,
#     whereas the two segments after it come from a cache that is only
#     refreshed while a session is busy, so they can sit hours behind. Shown to
#     cents below a dollar: a turn is small change, and "$0.0" would say nothing.
#   • today: share of today's budget still UNSPENT + ($ left/$ budget),
#     where the budget is simply "credits left at the start of today ÷ working
#     days left until the reset". Because it is recomputed from the CURRENT
#     balance every day, overshooting or undershooting today never carries a
#     debt — tomorrow just gets a smaller or larger slice, and the plan still
#     lands on 0 exactly at the reset. The arrow compares the share of the
#     budget spent against the share of the WORKING DAY (09:00–18:00 local)
#     elapsed, so it says "am I burning faster than the clock" (↑↗ green ahead /
#     none on-track / ↘ yellow / ↓ red too fast).
#   • AI Credits: a signed RESERVE in percentage points ("how much of the month's
#     entitlement I still have beyond what I should have left by now", i.e.
#     working-time elapsed − credits burned), joined by "⊂" to the remaining %
#     because the reserve is a PART of what is left, not another name for it;
#     then the balance in dollars with the credits in parentheses, then the
#     WORKING days + hours until the monthly quota resets. Signed number rather
#     than an arrow so it reads in the same unit as the "% left" beside it
#     — mirrors the weekly segment of victor-claude-statusline.md.
#   • money: everything on the line is DOLLARS at AIC_PER_USD credits per dollar.
#     Credits are an abstract unit — the dollar is the one both a burn rate and a
#     balance can be judged in without doing arithmetic in your head, and printing
#     both units on every figure ("$2.6≈257 AIC") doubled the width of each number
#     to say the same thing twice. The credit figure survives in exactly one place,
#     the monthly balance ("$198 (19819 AIC)"), because that is the number GitHub's
#     own UI quotes back in credits, so the line has to stay comparable with it —
#     parenthesised, as the footnote to the dollars rather than their equal.
#
#   • width: the finished line is cut to the terminal width with a "…" when it
#     would not fit. Copilot CLI redraws the status line in place, so a single
#     column too many makes the terminal wrap it onto a second row — which the
#     TUI then leaves behind as a stray leftover line instead of repainting it.
#
# Copilot CLI pipes the session status as JSON on stdin; we print one line to
# stdout. The monthly AI-Credit balance and reset date are NOT in that payload,
# so they come from a small cache refreshed in the background by quota-refresh.sh
# from `gh api copilot_internal/user`. See victor-copilot-statusline.md.
